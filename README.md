# Assignment 6: Medians, Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

## Overview
Implementation of selection algorithms and elementary data structures for MSCS532.

## Structure
```
part1_selection/          # Selection algorithms
part2_structures/         # Data structures  
tests/                    # Unit tests
main.py                   # Demo script
report.md                 # Analysis report
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py           # Run demonstrations
python -m pytest tests/  # Run tests
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- numpy, matplotlib (for analysis)

## Implemented Algorithms
**Part 1:** Median of Medians (O(n) deterministic), Randomized Quickselect (O(n) expected)

**Part 2:** Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees
